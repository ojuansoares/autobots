<h1 style="text-align: center">Autobots</h1>

The project's proposal is to develop a system called Autobots whose purpose is to be a system for managing stores specializing in vehicle maintenance and auto parts sales, as an application that works quickly and with access via the internet. Furthermore, the application must be flexible and easily integrated with other systems, if desired by customers. Therefore, the back-end architecture works in micro-services.

The project is divided into 5 parts (Example: ATVI, ATVII, ...) using the MVP concept where each part delivers a minimum viable product.
